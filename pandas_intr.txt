Pandas is a library built using NumPy specifically for data analysis. You'll be using Pandas heavily for data manipulation, visualisation, building machine learning models, etc.

There are two main data structures in Pandas - Series and Dataframes. The default way to store data is dataframes, and thus manipulating dataframes quickly is probably the most important skill set for data analysis.
